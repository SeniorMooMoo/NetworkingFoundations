# CCNA Lab Portfolio - Networking Foundations

This repository contains my completed lab projects and configurations for the Cisco CCNA 200-301 certification. The projects follow the curriculum from Jeremy's IT Lab and are designed to apply theoretical networking concepts to practical, hands-on scenarios using Cisco Packet Tracer.

Each project demonstrates foundational skills in routing, switching, and network security.
